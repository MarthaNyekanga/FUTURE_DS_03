# Demographic Data Cleaning and Analysis on Social Media Puchases in the USA

This project involves cleaning and analyzing a demographic dataset using Python and Pandas in Visual Studio Code. The dataset contains fields such as Age, Gender, and Location, and is prepared to support demographic analysis of social media purchasing behavior across selected regions in the USA.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Clean raw data by handling missing values
- Standardize column naming (e.g., capitalize column names)
- Extract meaningful demographic insights based on age, gender, and state/location

## 📁 Files and Structure

- `data.csv` — Raw dataset file (replace with your actual filename)
- `clean_data.py` — Python script used for data cleaning and analysis
- `README.md` — Project documentation (this file)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

- Dropped rows with missing values in important columns such as Age and Gender
- Renamed column headers to have capitalized names for consistency
  df.columns = [col.capitalize() for col in df.columns]
